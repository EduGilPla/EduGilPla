# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! You're probably here to check out what Iâ€™m currently coding and get to know me a bit â€” glad to have you around.

Most of the repos here are from my time studying, but I plan to update this space as I dive deeper into the things that truly interest me.

Hereâ€™s a bit about me:

- âœ¨ The languages Iâ€™m most comfortable with are Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript (in that order). Iâ€™ve also worked with C# and feel confident picking it back up. Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring Rust.
- ðŸŒ± I'm focusing on backend web development, exploring tools like Kafka, MongoDB, and more. I'm also revisiting systems programming to sharpen those fundamentals.
- ðŸ‘¯ I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy the friendly challenge of building the best possible solution with a team.
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to know more about me or get in touch, you can email me at eduardogilplasencia@gmail.com

Thanks for your time and I hope to hear more about you soon! ðŸ™‚
